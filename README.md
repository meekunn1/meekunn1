## Keiji M. Onishi

#### Professional 3D CAD designer with an interest in programming.
Improving my CAD skills to create cleaner, more reusable data has become my personal goal.


### Experience
Currently working as a CAD designer in a car model making company. (7 years and counting)\
Teamwork and communication are a must, because it takes a team to create a full-scale automobile model.

### Interests
- Love learning new ways to use CAD. Extra points if my new knowledge improves productivity.
- Currently learning full stack web development to feed my interest in programming.
